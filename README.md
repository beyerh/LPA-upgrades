# LPA-upgrades
This repository contains modified CAD models for 3D printing for the Light Plate Apparatus (LPA). The designs are based on the parts available in the [LPA-hardware](https://github.com/taborlab/LPA-hardware) repository of the Tabor lab.

Specifically, the "generic" design mounts transparent plates such as 24-well plates (or any other format) for uniform illumination. The design makes use of two layers of diffusor foil. In our tests, we have had the best experience with a product called " Makrofol LM 309 2-4".

The "hight-adjusted" design increases the distance between LED and plate in order to illuminate each well uniformly with the common LED light emission angle of about 30Â°.

Further, changes were made to tolerances for printing on a Prusa MK3S and MK4 printer.

The base plate is unchanged and available in the original repository.
